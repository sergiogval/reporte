# Report

## Summary

As you request it, I will provide a punctual answer for each one of your questions as complement to the statements I've made. I choose this format to do the report, since during the weekend I will work in a complementary part that will contains a detailed report. This is due the amount of evidence that I have collected during  months and my will to make it easy to understand. what I've been dealing with here may be hard to understand, if I don't present it in a proper way. For now I will just let you know that is  a fuse of different situations, some belong to Microverse  scope, some of them goes way beyond the school scope, but it may affect it. So, consider this as a live document.

Jumping into  work, I will proceed and provide answers to Emilia's questions.

1. Base64 encoded content in SVG file:

- [] The template I have chosen to work with is the fifth one. You may find the demo [here](https://sergiogval.github.io/temporal-portfolio-repo/)

- [] the image I'm talking about is the one that is in the landing page right side of the screen. Here you may find a link to the image ![screen-shot image.](../images/landing-page-image.png). that snippet on the debugger sections as far as I concern is harmless. Please correct me if im wrong. You may find the original files in the images folder. There you will find the encoded image. At first i thought this was some sort of code that when executed would return a snippet to animate the image. It wasn't the case. indeed i fond all kind of stuff in the in the embedded code. I went to vscode, since if figure out a pattern. each `//`was a separator. I found the following: ![codepen_output](../images/codepen_output.png)
